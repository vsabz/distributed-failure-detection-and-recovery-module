## About

I developed this project during my internship at Siemens AG. Failure detection is based on the following papers:

  * [The Failure Detector Abstraction](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41939126_The_Failure_Detector_Abstraction)
  * [Scalable and Fault Tolerant Failure Detection and Consensus](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299864842_Scalable_and_Fault_Tolerant_Failure_Detection_and_Consensus)
  * [The φ accrual failure detector](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/29682135_The_ph_accrual_failure_detector)
  * [Gossip-Style Failure Detection and Distributed Consensus for Scalable Heterogeneous Clusters](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220405937_Gossip-Style_Failure_Detection_and_Distributed_Consensus_for_Scalable_Heterogeneous_Clusters)
